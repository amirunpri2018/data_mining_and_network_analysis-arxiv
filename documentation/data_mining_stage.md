Data source description
-----------------------

The arXiv (pronounced "archive", as if the "X" were the Greek letter Chi, Ï‡) is a repository of electronic preprints, known as e-prints, of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance, which can be accessed online. In many fields of mathematics and physics, almost all scientific papers are self-archived on the arXiv.
