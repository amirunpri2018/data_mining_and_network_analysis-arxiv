Data source description
-----------------------

The arXiv (pronounced "archive", as if the "X" were the Greek letter Chi, Ï‡) is a repository of electronic preprints, known as e-prints, of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance, which can be accessed online. In many fields of mathematics and physics, almost all scientific papers are self-archived on the arXiv.

Each field has an abbreviation assigned e.g . 

- astrophysics : astro-ph
- mathematics : math
- computer science : cs
- quantitative biology : q-bio
- quantitative finance : q-fin
- statistics : stat

Users can view article listings for each year under list route. Results are paged, thus to cycle through all articles two number parameters are passed in query string to specify which page we need.

http://arxiv.org/list/{field_abbreviation}/{last_two_digits_of_year}?skip={number_of_articles}&show={number_of_articles}

Example: http://arxiv.org/list/math/00?skip=50&show=25 (show articles for Mathematics and year 2000 from 50 to 75)

It is helpful to know beforehan how many articles for given field and year are there. Script [generate_yearly_paper_counts.py](../generate_yearly_paper_counts.py) does precisely that and dumps the results into a json file.
