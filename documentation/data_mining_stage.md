Data source description
-----------------------

The arXiv (pronounced "archive", as if the "X" were the Greek letter Chi, Ï‡) is a repository of electronic preprints, known as e-prints, of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, quantitative biology, statistics, and quantitative finance, which can be accessed online. In many fields of mathematics and physics, almost all scientific papers are self-archived on the arXiv.

Each field has an abbreviation assigned e.g . 

- astrophysics : astro-ph
- mathematics : math
- computer science : cs
- quantitative biology : q-bio
- quantitative finance : q-fin
- statistics : stat

Iterating over all articles
---------------------------

Users can view article listings for each year under list route. Results are paged, thus to cycle through all articles two number parameters are passed in query string to specify which page we need.

http://arxiv.org/list/{field_abbreviation}/{last_two_digits_of_year}?skip={number_of_articles}&show={number_of_articles}

Example: http://arxiv.org/list/math/00?skip=50&show=25 (show articles for Mathematics and year 2000 from 50 to 75)

It is helpful to know beforehand how many articles for given field and year are there. Script [generate_yearly_paper_counts.py](../generate_yearly_paper_counts.py) does precisely that and dumps the results into a json file.

Having that knowledge under belt we can generate set of links that we need to crawl in order to gather the data we need.

Extracting articles identificators
----------------------------------

Using generated previously links we can can extract from each page useful information about article. We can extract its id and ids of its authors along with their full names. Unfortunately listings don't show any info about the abstracts. For that we'll crawle arXiv API.

In each page articles are contained inside __dl__ tag. With pairs of __dt__ and __dd__ tags. First link __dt__ has id embedded in it href in form: abs/{id}. There are at least two ID types on arXiv (and they're not interchangeable): 

- YYMM.NNNN (e.g. 1411.0027 leads to astrophysics paper from 2014 October)
- {field_name}/YYMM201 (e.g. math/9601201 leads to mathematics paper from 1996 January)
