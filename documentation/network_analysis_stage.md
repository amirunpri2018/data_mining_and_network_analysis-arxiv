# Network analysis stage

## Analyzed networks

Collected data was analyzed at two levels:
- full coauthorship network 
- coauthorship networks for each year and field

### Full coauthorship network

Nodes: 274014
Edges: 4471669

### Coauthorship networks for each year

In order to analyze network dynamics coauthorship graph is analyzed on a yearly basis.

## Extracted statistics

Everything that was possible to extract. More in network analysis results.
