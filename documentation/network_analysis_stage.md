# Network analysis stage

## Analyzed networks

Collected data was analyzed at two levels:
- full coauthorship network 
- coauthorship networks for each year and field

### Full coauthorship network

A large network consisting of >200k nodes and >4000k edges. 

### Coauthorship networks for each year

In order to analyze network dynamics coauthorship graph is analyzed on a yearly basis.
