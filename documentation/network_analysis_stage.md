# Network analysis stage

## Analyzed networks

Collected data was analyzed at two levels:
- full coauthorship network 
- coauthorship networks for each year and field

### Full coauthorship network

Some basic statistics are shown at global scale of the network.

### Coauthorship network division into time periods

In order to analyze network dynamics coauthorship graph is analyzed in four time periods:
1991 - 1999
2000 - 2004
2005 - 2010
2011 - 2013

### Coauthorship networks visualisation

In order to visualise coauthorship graphs are splitted by year and field.
